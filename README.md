Object Oriented Programming
- 4 pillars of OOP pillars = features

__init__ function: variables that are used within that class will be initialised, easier to call them later on.

## Encapsulation
- Technique of keeping internal state of object hidden from the outside.
- Keep your critical variables private e.g: address, email 
- Achieved using private attributes and providing public methods to access and update them.
- Syntax: __varname
- Storing the variable name that you think it's private in a capsule, so it can't easily changed.

## Abstraction
- Hiding the complex process details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
- Achieved by using Abstract class and method.
- Abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation.
- Python 'abc' module is required to create these classes and methods.

## Inheritance
- Mechanism of creating a new class based on an existing class, by inheriting properties (attributes and/or methods)
- Parent Class: The class from where the features are inherited from.
- Child class: The class that inherits the features.
- Benefits: Classes are created easily, easy maintenance.

## Polymorphism
- Ability to present the same interface for different data types.
- Allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
